                </header>
                <p>
                    <strong>Scenario</strong><br> You are part of the security team at Rhetorical Hospital and arrive to work one morning. On the ground of the parking lot, you find a USB stick with the hospital's logo printed on it. There’s no one else
                    around who might have dropped it, so you decide to pick it up out of curiosity. You bring the USB drive back to your office where the team has virtualization software installed on a workstation. Virtualization software can be used
                    for this very purpose because it’s one of the only ways to safely investigate an unfamiliar USB stick. The software works by running a simulated instance of the computer on the same workstation. This simulation isn’t connected to other
                    files or networks, so the USB drive can’t affect other systems if it happens to be infected with malicious software.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Contents</strong><br> The USB drive contains a mix of personal and work-related files belonging to Jorge Bailey, the human resource manager. The files include family and pet photos, a new hire letter, and an employee PII and shift
                    schedule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Attacker mindset</strong><br> In the hands of an attacker, the information on the USB drive could be exploited to impersonate Jorge, gain unauthorized access to the hospital's systems, or target other employees. Potential risk
                    of social engineering attacks against Jorge or his colleagues, impacting the hospital's security and compromising sensitive data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Risk analysis</strong><br> <strong>1.</strong>Operational Controls:<br> -Establish and enforce policies regarding the use of personal USB devices within the workplace.<br> -Educate employees, including Jorge, on security awareness
                    to recognize and report lost devices.<br> <strong>2.</strong>Managerial Controls:<br> -Enforce strict access controls to sensitive information, limiting the exposure of critical data.<br> -Conduct regular security audits to ensure
                    compliance with policies and identify areas for improvement in handling USB devices.<br> <strong>3.</strong>Best Practices: <br> -Encourage the use of passwords and encryption on USB drives to protect data.<br>- Ensure data backup
                    procedures are in place to mitigate the impact of a lost or compromised USB drive.
