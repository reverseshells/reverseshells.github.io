                    <h2>Apply filters to SQL queries</h2>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2>Project description</h2><br> I'm using SQL queries to dig into potential security issues tied to login attempts and employee machines in a big organization. By delving into the 'log_in_attempts' and 'employees' tables, I'm pinpointing
                    and fixing security concerns to keep the system safe. These SQL queries help me filter and extract specific data, letting me investigate failed logins, suspicious events, and gather employee details based on different criteria. This
                    project demonstrates how SQL can be a powerful tool in bolstering cybersecurity efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2>Retrieve after hours failed login attempts:</h2><br> In this query, I used the SQL statement:<br>
                    <strong>SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts WHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = 0;</strong><br>
                    <a><img src="images/sql1800.jpg" alt="" /></a><br> This query retrieves records from the 'log_in_attempts' table where the login attempts occurred after 18:00 and were unsuccessful (indicated by a 'success' value of 0 or FALSE). The result
                    shows 19 instances of failed logins after business hours, including details such as username, date, time, country, IP address, and success status. This information helps identify potential security incidents outside normal working
                    hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2>Retrieve login attempts on specific dates:</h2><br>
                    <strong>Task: </strong>You recently detected a suspicious event on 2022-05-09 and need to investigate login attempts on that day and the preceding day. Use SQL filters to create a query that identifies all login attempts occurring
                    on 2022-05-09 or 2022-05-08 from the log_in_attempts table<br>

                    <a><img src="images/dateSQL2.jpg" alt="" /></a><br>
                    <strong>SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09' OR login_date = '2022-05-08';</strong><br> This query retrieves records where the login attempts fall on either 2022-05-09 or 2022-05-08. The OR operator combines
                    the conditions, providing a comprehensive view of login activities on the specified dates.

                    <strong>WHERE country NOT LIKE 'MEX%';</strong><br> This query will give you a list of login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico, excluding both 'MEX' and 'MEXICO' entries in the country column.<br>

                    <strong>Task: </strong>Your team wants to perform security updates on specific employee machines in the Marketing department. Youâ€™re responsible for getting information on these employee machines and will need to query the <strong>employees </strong>table.
                    Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all employees in the Marketing department for all offices in the East building.<br>
