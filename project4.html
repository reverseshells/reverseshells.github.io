                    <strong>Scenario</strong><br> A small U.S. health care clinic specializing in delivering primary-care services experienced a security incident on a Tuesday morning, at approximately 9:00 a.m. Several employees reported that they were
                    unable to use their computers to access files like medical records. Business operations shut down because employees were unable to access the files and software needed to do their job. Additionally, employees also reported that a ransom
                    note was displayed on their computers. The ransom note stated that all the company's files were encrypted by an organized group of unethical hackers who are known to target organizations in healthcare and transportation industries.
                    In exchange for restoring access to the encrypted files, the ransom note demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. The attackers were able to gain access into the company's network by using targeted phishing
                    emails, which were sent to several employees of the company. The phishing emails contained a malicious attachment that installed malware on the employee's computer once it was downloaded. Once the attackers gained access, they deployed
                    their ransomware, which encrypted critical files. The company was unable to access critical patient data, causing major disruptions in their business operations. The company was forced to shut down their computer systems and contact
                    several organizations to report the incident and receive technical assistance.<br>

                    <strong>Description</strong><br> Our U.S. healthcare clinic faced a severe security incident, disrupting primary-care services. Employees experienced sudden computer access loss, hindering file retrieval, including critical medical
                    records. This forced a temporary business shutdown due to the inability to access essential files and software.

                    <strong>⦁	When: </strong>Tuesday at 9:00 a.m.
                    <strong>⦁	Where: </strong>At a health care company.
                    <strong>⦁	Why: </strong>The attackers gained access through targeted phishing emails, deploying ransomware for financial gain.

                    <strong>
                        Additional notes
                    </strong><br> It's crucial to investigate the phishing email's origin and content to better email security measures. Additionally, evaluating the clinic's incident response plan and its effectiveness during the
                    shutdown will provide insights into potential improvements. Consideration should be given to preventive measures, such as employee training and network segmentation, to bolster the clinic's cybersecurity posture against future attacks.
