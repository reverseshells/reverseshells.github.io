                    <h2>Scenario </h2><br> Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.<br> You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which
                    compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches
                    in the future. <br> After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:<br> ⦁ The organization’s employees' share passwords.<br> ⦁ The admin password for the
                    database is set to the default.<br> ⦁ The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.<br> ⦁ Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. <br> If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities,
                    the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future. <br> In this activity, you will write a security risk assessment to analyze the incident and explain what methods can be used to further
                    secure the network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2>Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement</h2><br> 1.Multifactor Authentication (MFA):<br> 2. Setting and enforcing strong password policies<br> 3. Setting firewall rules in place to filter traffic coming
                    in and out of the network and performing firewall maintenance regularly
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2>Part 2: Explain your recommendations</h2><br>
                    <strong>Multifactor Authentication (MFA):</strong><br> MFA will help security by requiring multiple forms of verification, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access, especially in scenarios where passwords are shared.<br>                    Mitigates the vulnerability of shared passwords and provides an additional layer of defense against a brute force or related attack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2>Setting and enforcing strong password policies:</h2><br> By setting up and consistently reinforcing a strong password policy across the organization, we make it way harder for bad actors to sneak into our network. Regularly sticking
                    to the rules laid out in the password policy is crucial to keeping everyone's online space secure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2>Setting firewall rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network and performing firewall maintenance regularly.</h2><br> Think of your network as a house. Firewall rule's function, as the bouncer determining who gains
                    entry and who is kept out. Routine maintenance involves inspecting locks and alarms to ensure security. It's about keeping the door locked and safeguarding the premises from online intruders
