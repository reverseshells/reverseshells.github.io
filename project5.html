                    <h1>Spear phishing</h1>
                </header>

                <p><strong>Scenario</strong><br> You’re a security analyst at an investment firm called Imaginary Bank. An executive at the firm recently received a spear phishing email that appears to come from the board of Imaginary Bank.
                    <strong>Spear phishing </strong>is a malicious email attack targeting a specific user or group of users, appearing to originate from a trusted source. In this case, the executive is being asked to install new collaboration software,
                    ExecuTalk.
                    <br> The executive suspects this email might be a phishing attempt because ExecuTalk was never mentioned during the last board meeting. They've forwarded the message to your team to verify if it’s legitimate. Your supervisor has tasked
                    you with investigating the message and determining whether it should be quarantined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sender's Email Address:</strong><br> The email is sent from "imaginarybank@gmail.org." While it may seem official at first glance, the use of a Gmail domain for a supposed communication from Imaginary Bank is suspicious. Legitimate
                    communications from an organization typically come from an official domain associated with the organization, not a generic Gmail account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Subject and Greeting:</strong><br> The subject line contains grammatical errors and misspelling, such as "Conglaturations" instead of "Congratulations." Legitimate professional communications would usually have correct spelling
                    and grammar. Additionally, the generic greeting "You have been added to a collaboration group 'Execs.'" lacks personalization, as legitimate communications would usually address the recipient by name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Urgency and Download Request:</strong><br> The email creates a sense of urgency, stating, "This invitation will expire in 48 hours, so act quickly." Phishing emails often use urgency tactics to pressure recipients into taking
                    immediate action. The message instructs the recipient to download ExecuTalk to their computer without prior mention or discussion of such software. Legitimate organizations typically communicate major software changes through official
                    channels, not via unsolicited emails.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Unusual Spelling:</strong><br> The message includes misspelled words like "Downlode" instead of "Download" and "ecsecutiv's" instead of "executive's." Legitimate communications from professional organizations would usually
                    have proper spelling and grammar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Download Options:</strong><br> The email provides download options for ExecuTalk on Mac, Windows, and Android. Phishing emails often contain links or attachments that lead to malicious sites or trigger malware downloads. It's
                    crucial to scrutinize such download requests, especially when they come unexpectedly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When investigating suspicious emails, hovering over buttons reveals the URL they redirect to without clicking. This allows you to check if it leads to a suspicious domain or if it links to an insecure "http://"
                    URL. Always exercise caution with unexpected download requests.
