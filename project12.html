                <p>
                    <h2>Summary: </h2>The company experienced a security event when all network services suddenly stopped responding. The cybersecurity team found the disruption was caused by a distributed denial of services (DDoS) attack through a flood
                    of incoming ICMP packets. The team responded by blocking the attack and stopping all non-critical network services, so that critical network services could be restored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2>Identify: </h2>A malicious actor targeted the company with an ICMP flood attack. The entire internal network was affected. All critical network resources needed to be secured and restored to a functioning state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2>Protect: </h2>The cybersecurity team implemented a new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets and an IDS/IPS system to filter out some ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2>Detect: </h2>The cybersecurity team configured source IP address verification on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses on incoming ICMP packets and implemented network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2>Respond: </h2>For future security events, the cybersecurity team will isolate affected systems to prevent further disruption to the network. They will attempt to restore any critical systems and services that were disrupted. Then,
                    the team will analyze network logs to check for suspicious and abnormal activity. The team will also report all incidents to upper management and appropriate legal authorities, if applicable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2>Recover: </h2>To recover from the DDoS attack, access to network services needs to be restored to a normal functioning state. In the future, external ICMP flood attacks can be blocked by the firewall. Once the flood of ICMP packets
                    has timed out, all non-critical network systems and services can be brought back online.
